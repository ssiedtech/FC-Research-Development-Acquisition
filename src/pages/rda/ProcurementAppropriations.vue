      <h1>PROCUREMENT APPROPRIATIONS</h1>
      <br />
      <p>ARMY PROCUREMENT APPROPRIATIONS 2031-2035</p>
      <br />
      <p>Could be up to 3 year appropriations</p>
      <br />
      <p>Congress can fund procurement programs in either an annual or a multiyear basis.</p>
      <p>If annual - you buy only a limited number for that year and no commitment is made for future year purchases.</p>
      <p>If multiyear - A commitment is made in the first year to buy and fund the weapon system over several years</p>
      <br />
      <p>2 approaches for funding Procurement Programs</p>
      <br />
      <p>Most common is Direct Funded Programâ€”material needs of the Army</p>
      <p>- Given money from Congress to buy something specific</p>
      <br />
      <p>Other method is Customer Funded Program--Materiel requirements placed on the Army by authorized customers, external to the Army</p>
      <p>- We own the M16 but the FBI wants it also so the FBI pays us money / also used Foreign Military Sales</p>
      <p>- We pay the Air Force for them to provide us with a capability</p>
      <br />
